# Netflix_Movie_recommendation_system
Business Problem:
Netflix is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies, they developed world-class movie
recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked
other movies. Netflix use those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customer’s unique tastes. And
while Cinematch is doing pretty well, it can always be made better. Now there are a lot of interesting alternative approaches to how Cinematch
works that netflix haven’t tried. Some are described in the literature, some aren’t. We’re curious whether any of these can beat Cinematch by
making better predictions. Because, frankly, if there is a much better approach it could make a big difference to our customers and our business. 

Problem Statement:
Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and a prediction accuracy bar that is 10% better than what Cinematch can do on the same
training data set. (Accuracy is a measurement of how closely predicted ratings of movies match subsequent actual ratings.)

I will collect the data from API :

I will use recommendation system to solve the problem .
What is a Recommender System?
A recommender system is an information filtering system that seeks to predicts the rating given by a user to an item. This predicted rating then used to
recommend items to the user. The item for which the predicted rating is high will be recommended to the user. This recommender system is utilized in
recommendation of a broad range of items. For instance, it can be used to recommend movies, products, videos, music, books, news, Facebook friends,
clothes, Twitter pages, Android/ios apps, hotels, restaurants, routes etc. It is used by almost all of the major companies to enhance their business and to
enrich user experience like YouTube for recommending videos, Amazon & Ebay for recommending products, Netflix for recommending Movies, Airbnb for
recommending rooms and hotels, Facebook for recommending friends etc.
